The response change may be breaking in rare cases.

# 1.3.1

- added compatibility to enable responses in exception to act like Net::HTTPResponse

# 1.3.0

- a block can be used to process a request's result, this enable to handle custom error codes or paththrought (design by Cyril Rohr)

- remove "Content-Length" and "Content-Type" headers when following a redirection (patch provided by haarts)
- all http error codes have now a corresponding exception class and all of them contain the Reponse -> this means that the raised exception can be different
- changed "Content-Disposition: multipart/form-data" to "Content-Disposition: form-data" per RFC 2388 (patch provided by Kyle Crawford)

The only breaking change should be the exception classes, but as the new classes inherits from the existing ones, the breaking cases should be rare.

# 1.2.0

- formatting changed from tabs to spaces
- logged requests now include generated headers
- accept and content-type headers can now be specified using extentions: RestClient.post "http://example.com/resource", { 'x' => 1 }.to_json, :content_type => :json, :accept => :json
- should be 1.1.1 but renamed to 1.2.0 because 1.1.X versions has already been packaged on Debian

- the mime-type code now rely on the mime-types gem http://mime-types.rubyforge.org/ instead of an internal partial list
- 204 response returns a Response instead of nil (patch provided by Elliott Draper)

All changes exept the last one should be fully compatible with the previous version.

NOTE: due to a dependency problem and to the last change, heroku users should update their heroku gem to >= 1.5.3 to be able to use this version.
