The CA path symlinks can be created by c_rehash(1ssl).

But in order for the tests to work on Windows, they have to be regular files.
You can turn them all into regular files by running this on a GNU system:

    for file in $(find . -type l); do
        cp -iv --remove-destination $(readlink -e $file) $file
    done
